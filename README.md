5. Notes 

* You may need to login to Figma to see the Figma prototype
* The embedding on the "Video Editing" may not work mainly because of YouTube's side so you can either click the "Video Editing" text to get redirected to YouTube or click the "Watch on YouTube" on the broken embed.
* The LinkedIn and other contacts are on the contact tab rather than about me tab
